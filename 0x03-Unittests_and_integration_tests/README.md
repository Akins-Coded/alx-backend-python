# 🧪 Unittests for `utils.py`

This project provides unittests for a utility module `utils.py`, written in Python 3.7 and designed to be compliant with strict coding and documentation standards.

---

## 📄 Project Description

The `utils.py` module contains generic utility functions used in other parts of a codebase, specifically:

- `access_nested_map()`: Accesses values in nested dictionaries using a sequence of keys.
- `get_json()`: Retrieves JSON content from a given URL.
- `memoize()`: A method decorator that caches method return values per instance.

This repo contains test coverage for `access_nested_map()` with both **positive** and **negative** test cases.
